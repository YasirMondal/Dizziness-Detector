# Dizziness Detector

A web-based Dizziness Detector** that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Python with Flask for the backend.
The system leverages **Mediapipe**, **OpenCV**, and **NumPy** to capture live facial motion through the camera and estimate the probability of dizziness in real time.

## Features
- Detects live facial motion via webcam.
- Calculates dizziness probability as a percentage.
- Real-time analysis with visual feedback.
- Simple and responsive web interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Libraries:** Mediapipe, OpenCV, NumPy  

## Installation
